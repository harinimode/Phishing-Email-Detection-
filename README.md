Phishing Email Detection (ML + URL Analysis)
📌 Overview
This project detects phishing emails using a machine learning model trained on email text data, combined with real-time URL scanning via the VirusTotal API.
It provides a multi-layer defense:

ML-based detection for suspicious language patterns.

URL-based detection for malicious or suspicious links.

🗂 Project Structure
```
PHISHING/
├── Phishing_Email.csv        # Dataset (email text + labels)
├── train_model.py           # Train the ML model and save it
├── testing_model.py         # Test the trained model on new samples
├── new_finalll.py           # Final script combining ML + VirusTotal API
└── model/                   # Folder containing saved .pkl model files
    └── phishing_model.pkl
```
**Features**
Preprocessing and TF-IDF vectorization of email text

Machine learning classifier: Logistic Regression

Train / test scripts separated for clarity

Final script (new_finalll.py) integrates ML prediction with VirusTotal API checks (URL/attachment reputation)

Model persistence in model/ as .pkl files for easy reuse

**Quick usage**

Install dependencies (example):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy joblib requests

```
Train the model:
```
python train_model.py
# saves model to model/phishing_model.pkl

```
Test the model on new samples:
```
python testing_model.py
# saves model to model/phishing_model.pkl
```
Run final combined flow (ML + VirusTotal):
```
python new_finalll.py
# make sure to set your VirusTotal API key in the script or via env var

```
⚙️ **Features**
Machine Learning Model (Logistic Regression + TF-IDF)

Suspicious URL Detection using:

Keyword heuristics

VirusTotal API lookup

Interactive CLI to test emails in real-time

High Accuracy (~97% on sample dataset)

📊 **Dataset**
The dataset (Phishing_Email.csv) contains:

Email Text → Email body/content

Label → Phishing or Safe

This dataset is from Kaggle and has been preprocessed for training.

🚀 **Installation & Setup**
1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phishing-email-detector.git

cd phishing-email-detector

2️⃣ Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
requirements.txt



scikit-learn
pandas
joblib
requests
python-dotenv
3️⃣ Add VirusTotal API Key
Create a .env file in the project folder:


VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
(If you don’t have an API key, get one from https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us)

🛠 Usage
Train the Model

python train_model.py
Test the Model

python testing_model.py
Run the Final Detection Tool


python new_finalll.py
Paste an email’s text into the terminal, and it will:

Predict Phishing or Safe using ML.

Extract URLs from the email.

Check them via VirusTotal API.

Return results + list of found URLs.
